WAYS IN WHICH THIS CODE SUCKS
=============================

- It has no user interface to speak of. For n-back n is selected by modifying the last line of code.
- It requires espeak to make sounds. Relatedly:
    - It also uses and hence requires pulseaudio.
    - It communicates with pulseaudio by having espeak output into a named pipe in the project directory.
      Which is just icky.
- It may or may not require python 2.7. Features like {1, 2, 3} (a set literal) might be special to 2.7.

USING IT
--------

Run "python nback.py" in the project directory to begin.
The last line of nback.py can be modified to change the value of "n".
Press "a" to signal a visual (position) match, and "l" for an audio (letter) match.
